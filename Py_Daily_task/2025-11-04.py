# Given two lists — one with last month’s marks and another with this month’s marks.
# print how many students improved their scores.
# Input:
# last_month_score = [45, 60, 70, 55, 80]
# this_month_score = [50, 58, 75, 65, 78]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: here students number 1, 3, and 4 are improved in the scores

# Answer :

last_month_score = [45, 60, 70, 55, 80]
this_month_score = [50, 58, 75, 65, 78]

count = 0

for i in range(len(last_month_score)):
    if this_month_score[i] > last_month_score[i]:
        count += 1

print(count)

# 2. Convert all spaces in a given sentence into - (without using in-built functions).
# ```python
# Input: "Learn Python Easily"
# Output: "Learn-Python-Easily"
# ```

# Answer :

sentence = "Learn Python Easily"
result = ""

for char in sentence:
    if char == " ":
        result += "-"
    else:
        result += char

print(result)


# 3. Find Index of an Element (Without using index() or any in-built methods) Write a program to find the index position of a given number manually using loops.
# python
# Input:
# numbers = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55]
# search = 33
# Output: 2


numbers = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55]
search = 33

index_position = -1 

for i in range(len(numbers)):
    if numbers[i] == search:
        index_position = i
        break

print(index_position)



# You are given two lists:
# One list shows the gender of each student ('M' for male, 'F' for female).
# The other list shows their marks in the same order.
# Write a Python program to:
# Find the average marks of male students.
# Find the average marks of female students.
# Print "Male <average>" if male students have the higher average, or "Female <average>" if female students have the higher average.

# For example:
# Test
# find_higher_average(['M','F','M','F','M','F','M'],
#                     [81.5, 70.0, 98.5, 60.0, 75.0, 50.0, 85.0]) 

# Output: Male 85.0

# find_higher_average(['M','F','M','F','M','F','M'],
#                     [59.5, 80.0, 61.0, 79.0, 60.5, 81.0, 60.0])

# Output: Female 80.0


def find_higher_average(gen_list, marks_list):
    male_sum = 0
    female_sum = 0
    male_count = 0
    female_count = 0

    for i in range(len(gen_list)):
        if gen_list[i] == 'M':
            male_sum += marks_list[i]
            male_count += 1
        else:
            female_sum += marks_list[i]
            female_count += 1

    male_avg = male_sum / male_count
    female_avg = female_sum / female_count

    if male_avg > female_avg:
        print("Male", male_avg)
    else:
        print("Female", female_avg)

# Question 1:
# Write a Python program to check if a given string is a Pangram or not.
# A Pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the English alphabet (a–z) at least once. 
# The check should be case-insensitive, meaning both uppercase and lowercase letters are treated the same.

# Test Case 1:
# Input:The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
# Output:True

# Explanation:
# The input string contains all the letters from ‘a’ to ‘z’, so it is a Pangram.

# Test Case 2:
# Input: The quick brown fox jumps over the dog
# Output: False

# Explanation:
# The input string is missing some letters (‘l’, ‘z’, and ‘y’), so it is not a Pangram.


# sentence = input("Enter one sentence: ")
# sentence = sentence.lower()
# words  = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# count=0
# for i in words:
#     if i in sentence:
#         count+=1
# if count==26:
#     print(True)
# else:
#     print(False)
